# Survival Quest


---

### **Project Overview**

**Title**: Survival Quest 
**Objective**: Create a 2D survival game where the player must gather resources, craft tools and weapons, and survive against waves of enemies. The game features a dynamic day-night cycle that affects gameplay.

### **Core Features to Implement**

#### **1. Resource Gathering**

**Description**: Allow players to collect various resources scattered throughout the game world.

- **Types of Resources**:
  - **Wood**: From trees.
  - **Stone**: From rocks.
  - **Food**: From plants or hunting animals.
  - **Metals**: From mining ores.

**Implementation Tips**:

- **Resource Nodes**: Create objects in the game world that represent resources (e.g., trees, rocks).
- **Interaction Mechanism**:
  - Use collision detection to determine when the player is near a resource.
  - Implement an action key (e.g., 'E' key) to gather resources.
- **Randomized Placement**: Distribute resources randomly or strategically across the map.

**Challenges**:

- Ensuring resources regenerate over time or are sufficiently abundant.
- Balancing resource availability with game difficulty.

#### **2. Crafting System**

**Description**: Enable players to combine collected resources to create tools, weapons, and other items necessary for survival.

- **Crafting Menu**:
  - Design a user-friendly interface that lists available recipes.
  - Show required materials and quantities.

- **Recipes**:
  - **Tools**: Axes, pickaxes, fishing rods.
  - **Weapons**: Swords, bows, arrows.
  - **Items**: Torches, traps, healing potions.

**Implementation Tips**:

- **Data Structures**:
  - Use dictionaries or classes to store recipes and their required resources.
- **Inventory System**:
  - Implement an inventory to track the player's collected resources.
  - Allow stacking of similar items.

**Challenges**:

- Managing inventory capacity and item stacking.
- Preventing crafting if required resources are insufficient.

#### **3. Day-Night Cycle**

**Description**: Introduce a time system that affects game mechanics, such as enemy behavior and resource availability.

- **Visual Representation**:
  - Change background colors or overlay transparent images to simulate time progression.
- **Gameplay Effects**:
  - **Daytime**: Safer exploration, more resources available.
  - **Nighttime**: Increased enemy spawns, reduced visibility.

**Implementation Tips**:

- **Time Tracking**:
  - Use Pygame's clock to increment a time variable.
  - Define the length of a full day-night cycle (e.g., 10 minutes).
- **Event Scheduling**:
  - Trigger events based on the time (e.g., enemies spawn at night).

**Challenges**:

- Synchronizing the day-night cycle with gameplay pacing.
- Adjusting difficulty to prevent nighttime from being too challenging or easy.

  - Use Pygame's font and drawing capabilities.

#### **4. Day-Night Cycle and Time Management**

- **Time Variables**:
  - `current_time`, `day_length`, `night_length`.
- **Visual Effects**:
  - Overlay semi-transparent surfaces to simulate lighting changes.
- **Event Triggers**:
  - Change enemy spawn rates based on `current_time`.

#### **5. Resource Gathering Mechanics**

- **Collision Detection**:
  - Use Pygame's sprite groups and collision functions.
- **Resource Depletion and Regeneration**:
  - Remove resource nodes when depleted.
  - Use timers to regenerate resources after a set period.

#### **6. Enemy AI**

- **Behavior States**:
  - Idle, patrol, chase, attack.
- **Pathfinding**:
  - Simple movement towards the player.
  - For advanced AI, consider implementing pathfinding algorithms like A*.

#### **7. Graphics and Assets**

- **Sprites and Animations**:
  - Use sprite sheets for player and enemy animations.
- **Environment Tiles**:
  - Design or source tiles for the game world (grass, water, trees).
- **User Interface Elements**:
  - Health bars, hunger meters, time of day indicators.

#### **8. Sound and Music**

- **Background Music**:
  - Different tracks for day and night.
- **Sound Effects**:
  - Collecting resources, crafting items, combat sounds.
